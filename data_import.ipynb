[DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html) is a Databricks File System that allows you to store data for querying inside of Databricks. This notebook assumes that you have a file already inside of DBFS that you would like to read from.\n\nThis notebook is written in **Python** so the default cell type is Python. However, you can use different languages by using the `%LANGUAGE` syntax.
